A dropdown menu is a graphical control element that allows users to select one option from a list of predefined choices.

## Best Practices

### Semantic HTML

No need to reinvent the wheel. Use a `<select>` element for the dropdown menu. This element is well-supported by assistive technologies and is familiar to users. Custom CSS options run the risk of undoing some of these visual and functional indicators.

### Descriptive Labels

Always use the `<label>` element to associate a label with the `<select>` element. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies to correctly identify and describe the purpose of the dropdown.

### Sensible Defaults

Include a default, non-selectable option (e.g., "Select an option") as the first `<option>` element with an empty value attribute. This ensures that users know the purpose of the dropdown and prompts them to make a selection.

## Example

<Canvas of={DropdownStories.Default} />
