# Breadcrumb

A "breadcrumb trail" consists of a list of links to the parent pages of the current page in hierarchical order. It helps users find their place within a website or web application. [Source](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/breadcrumb/)

## Best Practices
- Use `<nav>` element to represent the breadcrumb navigation area which implicitly includes `role="navigation"` on the element.
- Use `<ol>` element to represent the breadcrumb list which appears in ascending hierarchical order.
- Use `<a aria-current="page">` for the breadcrumb link that indicates the current page. This should always appear last in the list.
- Use CSS to accomplish visual separators between links rather than markup, so they aren't announced by screen readers.

## Example

<Canvas>
	<Story
		name="Breadcrumb"
		args={{
			items: [
				{
					title: 'Home',
					url: '#'
				},
				{
					title: 'Category',
					url: '#'
				},
				{
					title: 'Current Page',
					url: '#'
				}
			]
		}}>
		{Template.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>
