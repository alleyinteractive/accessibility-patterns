A "breadcrumb trail" consists of a list of links to the parent pages of the current page in hierarchical order. It helps users find their place within a website or web application. [Source](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/breadcrumb/)

## Best Practices
- Use `<nav>` element to represent the breadcrumb navigation area which implicitly includes `role="navigation"` on the element.
- Use `<ol>` element to represent the breadcrumb list which appears in ascending hierarchical order.
- Use `<a aria-current="page">` for the breadcrumb link that indicates the current page. This should always appear last in the list.
- Use CSS to accomplish visual separators between links rather than markup, so they aren't announced by screen readers.

## Example

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbStories.Default} />
