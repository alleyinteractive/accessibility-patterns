From [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/dialog_role):
> The dialog role is used to mark up an HTML based application dialog or window that separates content or UI from the rest of the web application or page. Dialogs are generally placed on top of the rest of the page content using an overlay. Dialogs can be either non-modal (it's still possible to interact with content outside of the dialog) or modal (only the content in the dialog can be interacted with).

## Best Practices

Best practices can be broken down into two categories: labeling and focus management.

### Labeling
- `role='dialog`: Used to designate an HTML element that separates UI or content from the rest of the page.
- `aria-labelledby`: This attribute labels the dialog. Its value should be the ID of the attribute that contains the labeling text (often the dialog's title element).
- `aria-describedby`: This attribute designates content that describes the dialog. This will often be the ID of the element containing explanatory text in the dialog.

### Focus
- The dialog should be able to be triggered using keyboard navigation.
- When the dialog is opened, focus should transfer to the first focusable element in the dialog.
- When the dialog is closed, focus should return to the button/element that initiated the opening of the dialog.
